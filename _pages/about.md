## About Me

I am Tsung-Han (Patrick) Wu, a PhD student (Aug. 2023 - ) at UC Berkeley advised by [Prof. Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) and [Prof. Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/) at BAIR/Sky Computing Lab. Previously, I worked as a reserach scientist intern at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) and was a core member of the [Search Arena](https://news.lmarena.ai/search-arena) project at LMArena. I earned by MS and BS degree in CS from National Taiwan University (NTU), where I collaborated with Prof. [Shang-Tse Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/) and Prof. [Winston H. Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). 

My recent research focuses on pushing natural human-AI interaction, where models handle diverse user inputs and generate self-corrective, factual, and preference-aligned responses. Before this, my efforts were dedicated to developing cost-effective and trustworthy visual autonomous systems in our changing world.  Feel welcome to check out my [selected publications](https://tsunghan-wu.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://tsunghan-wu.github.io/files/cv.pdf) for more information.
