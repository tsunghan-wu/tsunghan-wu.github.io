Welcome! I'm a M.S. student (Sep 2020 - ) in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), supervised by Prof. [Winston H. Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). I plan to apply for a Ph.D student position in 2022 Fall.

My research interest broadly includes the deep learning technique for computer vision and 3D scene understanding. My research goal is to design intellegent systems which are able to understand images and 3D scenes in efficient ways. Specifically, my research focuses on active learning, depth estimation/completion, and point cloud processing. If you are interested in my research or have any use cases that you want to share, feel free to [contact me](tsunghan@cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw)!

Previously, I was an undergraduate student in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU). I received the NTU Presidential Award for the top 5% students for three times in 2016-2020, and Foxconn Technology Award in 2021. Here is my Curriculum Vitae.
