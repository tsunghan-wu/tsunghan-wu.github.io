## About Me

Hi, my name is Tsung-Han (Patrick) Wu. I am an EECS PhD student (Aug. 2023 - ) at UC Berkeley, focusing on Computer Vision and ML Systems. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Trevor Darrell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/) affiliated with BAIR and [Prof. Joseph E. Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/) in Sky computing Lab. I'm also a research scientist intern at [Meta](https://ai.meta.com/research/) working with [Kate Saenko](https://ai.bu.edu/ksaenko.html) and [Nicolas Carion
](https://www.nicolascarion.com) during the 2024 summer. Previously, I earned by MS and BS degree in Computer Science from National Taiwan University (NTU), happily collaborating with Prof. [Shang-Tse Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/) and Prof. [Winston H. Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). 

My recent research endeavors are focused on **analyzing the limitations and exploring the zero-shot applications of LLMs / LMMs**. Before this, my efforts were dedicated to developing cost-effective and trustworthy visual autonomous systems in our changing world.  Feel welcome to check out my [selected publications](https://tsunghan-wu.github.io/publications/) and [CV](https://tsunghan-wu.github.io/files/cv.pdf) for more information.
