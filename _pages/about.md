Hi, my name is Tsung-Han Wu (吳宗翰). I'm a research assistant (Aug. 2022 - ) in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU), collaborating with Prof. [Shang-Tse Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/) and Prof. [Winston H. Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). Currently, I plan to apply for a Ph.D student position in 2022 Fall.

My research interest broadly includes the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, my research focuses on **active learning**, **adversarial robustness**, **depth estimation/completion**, and **3D vision**. Here is my recent [publications](https://tsunghan-wu.github.io/publications/). If you are interested in my research or want to discuss with me, feel free to [email me](tsunghan@cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw)!

Previously, I received my MS and BS degree in Computer Science at National Taiwan University (NTU). I received the NTU Dean's List Award for the top 5% students for three times in 2016-2020, [Foxconn Technology Award](https://www.facebook.com/foxconnscholarship/photos/a.316005262172506/1316061712166851/) in 2021, and [IPPR Outstanding MS Thesis Award](http://140.125.183.142/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/\%E7\%AC\%AC\%E5\%8D\%81\%E4\%BA\%94\%E5\%B1\%86\%E5\%8D\%9A\%E7\%A2\%A9\%E5\%A3\%AB\%E8\%AB\%96\%E6\%96\%87\%E7\%8D\%8E\%E7\%8D\%B2\%E7\%8D\%8E\%E5\%90\%8D\%E5\%96\%AE-1.pdf) in 2022.
